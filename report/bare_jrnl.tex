\section{Ellitic Curves}
This question has been divided into four parts, labeled A through D.

\subsection{Part a}
The order of my group is twenty four. 

\subsection{Part b}
Yes, of course it is. 

\subsection{Part c}
Elliptic curves have the interesting property of that any two points on the
lien will intersect the line again at another point. This can be used as a
group operator, and used to generate a group. For some reason this new group
can be nice and secure.  

\subsection{Part d}
Answer here. 


\section{Vigenere Cipher}
We were given the following message, and told to decrypt it:

\section{Two Part Encryption}
The file ``secret.hex'' contained a secret message. The message had been
encyrpted in two stages, the first stage was unknown, and the second stage was
a simple XOR based cipher. We were given the first two characters of the
intermediate text --`Hg'.

To decrypt the message, the two stages had to be performed in reverse order:
first the XOR stage, followed by the unknown cipher stage. 

I began by creating a python script that first reads in the secret message, and
then retrieves the key for the known portion of the message. Given that we only
had two letters of the intermediate text, I guessed that the key length of the
message is two, and repreated the key that I had retrieved for the length of
the message to retrieve some text. The Python code that I used to decode the
message into it's intermediate form is as follows:

\begin{python}
with open("secret.hex") as f:
    ciphertext = f.read()

    k1 = chr(ord(ciphertext[0:1]) ^ ord("H"))
    k2 = chr(ord(ciphertext[1:2]) ^ ord("g"))
    keystream = (k1 + k2) * (len(ciphertext) / 2)

    plaintext = "".join(
            [chr(ord(k) ^ ord(c)) 
             for k, c in zip(keystream, ciphertext)]
    )

    print plaintext
\end{python}

This resulted in the followin intermediate text: 

\begin{lstlisting}

By simple inspection, this looked like it was likely to be the output of a
basic cipher -- the message contains only alphabetic characters, and there are
spaces evenly distributed throughout the text. Although this could have just
been by chance, it definitely looked like a good lead to follow.

As I believed this text looked like human language, I decided the next step was to calculate the Index of Coincidence (IC) for this text. The IC is a weighted sum of the frequency of the letters, and can be used to identify if a ciphertext has the same frequency distribution as a given language. If it has the same distribution, then the cipher is a simple substitution cipher. The IC is calculated as:

$$
\textup{IC} =  \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{c} n_i(n_i -1)}{N(N - 1)/c}
$$

Where $N$ is the length of the text. $n_1$ to $n_c$ are the counts
for each of the possible characters. And $c$ is the number of
letters in the alphabet. 

To calculate the IC, I used the following python script. 
\begin{python}
from __future__ import division
import string

with open("intermediate.txt") as f: 
    s = f.read()

    freq = {}

    for c in string.ascii_uppercase:
        freq[c.upper()] = 0

    for c in s:
        if c.upper() in string.ascii_uppercase:
            freq[c.upper()] += 1
                           
    N = sum([n for n in freq.values()])
    c = len(string.ascii_uppercase)

    numerator = sum([(n * (n-1)) for n in freq.values()]) 
    denominator = ((N * (N-1))/c)

    IC = numerator / denominator 

    print IC
\end{python}

The value calculated for the IC was ``1.7086'', which is very close to that of
the English language (1.73). This finding confirmed my belief that the cipher
used was some form of monoalphabetic substitution.  

By copying the intermediate text into {\tt vim}, and using the search and
replace functionality (s/x/Y/g), I began substituting letters with likely
substitutions. 

Eventually, I managed to obtain the following message. As the message, makes
sense to me in English, I am confident that this passage is the correct
plaintext. 

\begin{lstlisting}
THE MEANING OF LIFE IS THE MOST PROFOUND AND ELUSIVE MYSTERY
OF THEM ALL, UNKNOWN TO EVEN THE GREATEST MINDS. SURELY
ANYONE WHO TELLS YOU THEY HAVE THE ANSWER IS JOKING, MAD OR
SIMPLY MISTAKEN.  THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT MAKE LIFE WORTH
HOLDING ON TO AND SAVOURING. BUT LIFE IS UNPREDICTABLE AND
WE ARE OFTEN MYSTERIES EVEN TO OURSELVES. WE THINK SUCCESS,
HAPPINESS, HELPING OTHERS, OR SURPASSING OURSELVES WILL MAKE
LIFE WORTH LIVING, BUT WE CAN ALWAYS BE WRONG OR FRUSTRATED
BY EVENTS.  THIS IS A RANDOM PHRASE.  PHILOSOPHERS HAVE A
LOT TO SAY ABOUT THE VALUE OF ALL THESE THINGS, AND A LITTLE
LESS TO SAY ABOUT ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE THINGS OF ALL:
LOVE. SO WE CAN BE CLEAR ENOUGH ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS FOR LIFE
TO HAVE MEANING AND VALUE, BUT WHEN WE PUT DOWN OUR
PHILOSOPHY BOOKS AND ACTUALLY GET ON WITH LIVING, MEANING
AND VALUE CAN BE ELUSIVE. LIVING WELL IS MORE ART THAN
SCIENCE OR PHILOSOPHY. THEREFORE,  THE ONLY SENSE WE CAN
MAKE OF THE IDEA THAT LIFE HAS MEANING IS THAT THERE ARE
SOME REASONS TO LIVE RATHER THAN TO DIE, AND THOSE REASONS
ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE LIVING OF LIFE ITSELF.

\section{Headline Puzzles}
This question has been divided into five parts, labeled 1 to 5.

I found this question more challenging than first expected because:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ciphertext not long enough to perform frequency analysis
\item Keyspace is too large to brute force
\item We cannot be certain of the encryption mechanism
\item Some of the texts do not contain any double characters (e.g. "oo")
\end{itemize}
