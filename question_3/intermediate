THE MEANING OF LIFE IS THE MOST PROFOUND AND ELUSIVE MYSTERY OF THEM ALL,
UNKNOWN TO EVEN THE GREATEST MINDS. SURELY ANYONE WHO TELLS YOU THEY HAVE THE
ANSWER IS JOKING, MAD OR SIMPLY MISTAKEN. THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT MAKE LIFE
WORTH HOLDING ON TO AND SAVOURING. BUT LIFE IS UNPREDICTABLE AND WE ARE OFTEN
MYSTERIES EVEN TO OURSELVES. WE THINK SUCCESS, HAPPINESS, HELPING OTHERS, OR
SURPASSING OURSELVES WILL MAKE LIFE WORTH LIVING, BUT WE CAN ALWAYS BE WRONG OR
FRUSTRATED BY EVENTS. THIS IS A RANDOM PHRASE. PHILOSOPHERS HAVE A LOT TO SAY
ABOUT THE VALUE OF ALL THESE THINGS, AND A LITTLE LESS TO SAY ABOUT ONE OF THE
MOST VALUABLE THINGS OF ALL: LOVE. SO WE CAN BE CLEAR ENOUGH ABOUT WHAT IT
MEANS FOR LIFE TO HAVE MEANING AND VALUE, BUT WHEN WE PUT DOWN OUR PHILOSOPHY
BOOKS AND ACTUALLY GET ON WITH LIVING, MEANING AND VALUE CAN BE ELUSIVE. LIVING
WELL IS MORE ART THAN SCIENCE OR PHILOSOPHY. THEREFORE,  THE ONLY SENSE WE CAN
MAKE OF THE IDEA THAT LIFE HAS MEANING IS THAT THERE ARE SOME REASONS TO LIVE
RATHER THAN TO DIE, AND THOSE REASONS ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE LIVING OF LIFE
ITSELF.
